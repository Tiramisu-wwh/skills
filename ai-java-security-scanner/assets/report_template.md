### Executive Summary Requirements

The executive summary should be suitable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders:

1. **Overall Risk Assessment**
   - Single sentence risk rating
   - Supporting risk score and rationale
   - Business impact in business terms

2. **Key Statistics**
   - Files scanned vs vulnerabilities found ratio
   - Critical/high count that needs immediate attention
   - Comparison to previous scans (if available)

3. **Prioritized Findings**
   - Top 3 vulnerability types by risk
   - Files requiring immediate attention
   - Quick wins (easy to fix, high impact)

### Detailed Findings Format

For each vulnerability, include:

```markdown
**[Number]. [Vulnerability Type]**
**Location:** `file_path:line_number`
**CWE ID:** [CWE-ID]

**Description:** [Clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact]

**Vulnerable Code:**
```java
[Code snippet with vulnerable line highlighted]
```

**Remediation:** [Specific fix recommendation with code example if applicable]
```

### Risk Assessment Criteria

Use the following criteria for risk assessment:

**Critical (10 points)**
- Remote code execution
- Complete system compromise
- Data breach of sensitive information
- Immediate threat requiring urgent action

**High (7 points)**
- Privilege escalation
- Significant data manipulation
- Service disruption
- Should be addressed within 1-2 weeks

**Medium (4 points)**
- Information disclosure
- Limited system impact
- Should be addressed in next development cycle

**Low (1 point)**
- Best practice violation
- Minimal security impact
- Can be addressed in future releases

### Remediation Recommendations

Structure recommendations by priority:

#### Immediate Actions (Critical & High Risk)
1. List each critical/high vulnerability type
2. Provide specific code fixes
3. Include affected files count
4. Estimate fix time

#### Short-term Actions (Medium Risk)
1. Group by vulnerability category
2. Provide general remediation approach
3. Include timeline recommendations

#### Long-term Actions (Low Risk & Process Improvements)
1. Security best practices
2. Process improvements
3. Training recommendations

### Compliance Mapping

Map findings to relevant standards:
- OWASP Top 10
- CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)
- Industry-specific requirements (PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.)
- Internal security policies

### Visual Elements

Include visual aids when possible:
- Risk distribution charts (pie chart for risk levels)
- Trend graphs (for historical data)
- Heat maps (vulnerability concentration by file/directory)
- Compliance scorecards

## Quality Standards

### Accuracy Requirements
- False positive rate < 5%
- All critical findings must be verified
- Code snippets must be accurate
- Remediation advice must be tested

### Clarity Requirements
- Technical accuracy with business context
- Actionable recommendations
- Clear priority ordering
- Appropriate language for audience

### Completeness Requirements
- All vulnerability categories covered
- No duplicate findings
- Complete file paths and line numbers
- Comprehensive remediation guidance

## Executive Summary

### Overall Risk Assessment
🚨 **Overall Risk Rating: CRITICAL**
**Risk Score:** 73 points

### Key Findings
🚨 **Critical vulnerabilities detected**: SQL Injection, Command Injection
⚠️ **High-risk issues**: 12 vulnerabilities requiring prompt attention
⚡ **Security posture**: Multiple critical flaws in authentication module

### Business Impact
- **Data breach risk**: High - SQL injection could expose customer data
- **System compromise risk**: Critical - Command injection allows server takeover
- **Compliance risk**: High - Multiple violations of security standards
- **Reputation impact**: Significant - Security flaws could affect customer trust

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Fix SQL injection in login module (2 critical vulnerabilities)
2. Address command injection in file upload functionality (1 critical vulnerability)
3. Review and patch authentication bypass issues (3 high vulnerabilities)
```

### Detailed Finding Example

```
**1. SQL Injection**
**Location:** `src/main/java/com/example/auth/LoginService.java:45`
**CWE ID:** CWE-89

**Description:** SQL injection vulnerability in user authentication allows attackers to bypass login and access sensitive user data.

**Vulnerable Code:**
```java
>>>   43: public boolean authenticate(String username, String password) {
>>>   44:     String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username +
>>>   45:                    "' AND password = '" + password + "'";
>>>   46:     Statement stmt = connection.createStatement();
>>>   47:     ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
```

**Remediation:** Use parameterized queries with PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection:

```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = connection.prepareStatement(query);
pstmt.setString(1, username);
pstmt.setString(2, password);
ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery(query);
```

**Business Impact:** Critical - Could allow complete database compromise and unauthorized access to all user accounts.
